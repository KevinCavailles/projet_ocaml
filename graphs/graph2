%% Enter the 2 sets one after the other
%% each element separated by a coma

s a,b,c,d,e,f 
s j1,j2,j3,j4,j5,j6	

%% Enter the capacity for the second set   /!\ INT only
%% either a single number which will be the capacity of every second set's element
%% or a list of number such as |list| = |S2|
%% ex : 
%%      s a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l
%%      s j1,j2,j3
%%      c 5,20,10
%%      (c 5  <=> c 5,5,5 in this case)

c 1

%% Enter the preferences one by one with the format : elemS1 -> elemS2 : pref n°X    /!\ INT only for X
%% with X from 1 to |S2|, 1 being the most desired, |S2| being the least desired
%% (You can actually put any number, the rule is that for X and Y, X < Y, 
%% the element corresponding to X is more preferred than the one corresponding to Y)
